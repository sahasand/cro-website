# World-class CRO website copy built to convert

**Every major CRO promises the same things — speed, partnership, patient-centricity, innovation.** The research across IQVIA, Medpace, PPD, Parexel, ICON, and Syneos Health reveals a market drowning in identical language: "accelerate drug development," "life-changing therapies," "seamless integrated solutions." Meanwhile, sponsors report the same frustrations year after year: team turnover, scope creep, deprioritized trials, buried data problems. The copy below exploits every gap in current CRO messaging — leading with radical transparency, measurable commitments, biometrics-first positioning, and language that treats decision-makers as the intelligent scientists they are.

The differentiating strategy woven throughout: **this CRO positions data integrity and biometrics as the strategic backbone of every trial — not a line item buried four clicks deep.** It addresses the documented anxieties of biotech sponsors directly, makes specific operational commitments no competitor currently makes, and uses plain, confident language in a market saturated with corporate abstraction.

# HOMEPAGE

---

## Hero section

### Your trial's success is decided by the quality of your data. We make data the lead, not the afterthought.

Most CROs treat biostatistics and data management as downstream functions — staffed late, scoped thin, disconnected from your protocol design. We build every trial around data integrity from Day 1. The result: cleaner databases, faster locks, submission-ready packages that don't get sent back.

## The problem we solve

### Every year, promising compounds fail — not because the science was wrong, but because the execution was.

**80% of clinical trials miss enrollment timelines.** Protocol amendments delay programs by an average of four months. Data quality issues surface at database lock, when fixing them costs ten times what prevention would have. CRO staff rotate off your trial mid-study, taking institutional knowledge with them.

You've heard every CRO promise "partnership." You've seen senior scientists pitch your trial, then hand it to junior associates. You've watched budgets swell with change orders that weren't in the original scope.

We built this organization to solve those specific problems — not with slogans, but with operational commitments we publish and measure against.

---

## Three commitments we make (and measure)

**Your team stays your team.** The scientists who design your analysis plan are the same scientists who deliver your topline results. We track and publish our project team continuity rate because we believe accountability starts with transparency.

**Your data strategy starts at protocol design.** Our biostatisticians and data managers join your program before the first CRF is drafted — not after the first patient is enrolled. Early engagement with CDISC standards, estimand frameworks, and endpoint strategy prevents the costly rework that derails timelines downstream.

**Your budget reflects reality.** We scope conservatively, price honestly, and define every change-order trigger in the contract before you sign. No surprises. No "we'll figure it out later."

**[CTA: Speak With a Scientific Advisor — We'll Respond Within 24 Hours]**

## What we deliver

We provide integrated biometrics, clinical operations, quality management, and regulatory services across Phase I–IV — with particular depth in data management, biostatistics, statistical programming, and site monitoring. We work across broad therapeutic areas while maintaining the scientific depth that sponsors in oncology, CNS, rare disease, immunology, and cardiometabolic indications demand.

Our delivery models flex to your needs: full-service outsourcing, functional service partnerships (FSP), or hybrid configurations designed around how your organization actually operates — not around our internal org chart.

---

---

# SERVICE PAGE: QUALITY MANAGEMENT

---

## Quality you can measure, not just quality you're promised

Every CRO claims a "commitment to quality." We publish ours. Our quality management system is built on ICH E6(R3) principles — Quality by Design, risk-based oversight, and Critical-to-Quality factor identification — implemented today, not retrofitted when regulators require it.

Quality at most CROs lives in a compliance department. Here, it reports to executive leadership and operates independently from clinical operations — because quality assurance loses its value the moment it answers to the people it's supposed to audit.

---

### Quality by Design starts before your first patient

We don't bolt quality onto a running trial. We engineer it into the protocol. During study design, our QA team works alongside biostatistics, data management, and clinical operations to identify **Critical-to-Quality (CtQ) factors** — the attributes that determine whether your data will be reliable enough to support a regulatory decision.

This means prospective risk assessments using structured frameworks (RACT, FMEA), not retrospective damage control. It means defining acceptable ranges for your critical parameters before enrollment opens, then monitoring them centrally throughout the trial. When a metric drifts outside tolerance, our system flags it in real time — not at your next quarterly review.

---

### Risk-Based Quality Management that actually functions

RBQM adoption across the industry sits at roughly **55%** in practice, despite **88%** of organizations endorsing it in principle. The gap exists because RBQM requires more than a technology purchase — it demands an integrated operating model where centralized monitoring, on-site oversight, quality metrics, and CAPA processes communicate continuously.

Our RBQM framework operates on six linked steps:

**Identify** critical data and processes during protocol development. **Evaluate** risk probability, detectability, and impact using quantitative scoring. **Control** risks through targeted monitoring plans, edit checks, and site-level interventions. **Communicate** findings across every functional team in real time through shared dashboards. **Review** risk profiles at pre-defined intervals and after every significant protocol event. **Report** quality management activities in formats that satisfy FDA, EMA, PMDA, and Health Canada expectations.

The technology layer integrates centralized statistical monitoring with KRI dashboards, enabling our quality team to detect anomalous site-level patterns — digit preference, unusual variance distributions, atypical enrollment curves — before they compromise your dataset.

---

### Audit readiness is a state, not an event

We operate under the principle that every trial should be inspection-ready at all times — not scrambled into shape when an FDA 483 notice arrives. This requires:

**A living Trial Master File.** Our eTMF completeness metrics are tracked in real time. Essential documents — delegation logs, training records, IRB correspondence, informed consent documentation — are current and accessible, not buried in email chains. We apply ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) to every data record.

**A CAPA system that closes the loop.** Our Corrective and Preventive Action process follows a rigorous eight-step methodology: detection, documentation, root cause analysis (using 5 Whys, Ishikawa, or fault tree methods as appropriate), corrective action, preventive action, implementation, effectiveness verification, and closure. CAPAs are only closed after effectiveness is confirmed — not when the paperwork is filed. Critically, we track CAPAs across studies to identify systemic patterns that single-study analysis misses.

**An SOP infrastructure that evolves.** We maintain a comprehensive library of standard operating procedures covering every GCP-relevant function — from monitoring visit conduct to safety reporting to vendor oversight. SOPs are reviewed annually, updated in response to CAPA findings and regulatory changes, and linked to our training management system so that every revision automatically triggers competency reassessment.

---

### Our quality commitment

We conduct mock inspections and pre-audit readiness assessments for every pivotal trial. We share quality metrics with sponsors through real-time dashboards — not sanitized quarterly summaries. When we find a problem, you hear about it first from us, not from an auditor.

**[CTA: Discuss Your Quality Requirements With Our QA Leadership]**

# SERVICE PAGE: DATA MANAGEMENT

---

## Clean data isn't a deliverable. It's a discipline that starts at CRF design.

Data management failures don't announce themselves loudly. They accumulate quietly — an ambiguous CRF field here, an unchecked edit rule there, a medical coding inconsistency discovered three weeks before your database lock deadline. By the time you see the problem, fixing it costs ten times what prevention would have.

Our data management practice is structured around one principle: **every decision made during study design should make database lock faster, not harder.** That means CDASH-aligned CRFs mapped to SDTM domains before your first site opens. It means edit checks programmed against your analysis plan, not just your protocol. It means continuous cleaning throughout enrollment — not a frantic three-week sprint after last patient last visit.

---

### CRF design built for analysis, not just collection

Most CRFs are designed to collect data. Ours are designed to analyze it. The distinction matters.

We build every case report form against a **CRF-to-protocol traceability matrix** that maps each data element to its protocol objective, CDASH standard, and downstream SDTM domain. Controlled terminology, value-level metadata, and derivation logic are defined at design — not reverse-engineered months later by a statistical programmer seeing the data for the first time.

Edit checks and skip logic are embedded directly into the electronic CRF, catching range violations, cross-form inconsistencies, and data entry errors at the point of capture. This reduces downstream query volume by catching problems when sites can still remember the clinical context — rather than six months later when source documents have been archived.

---

### EDC expertise across platforms, without platform lock-in

We maintain validated expertise across the major EDC platforms sponsors use — **Medidata Rave, Oracle Clinical One, Veeva Vault CDMS, Viedoc** — and design our processes to be platform-agnostic. Your study builds are executed by programmers who know the system, validated through User Acceptance Testing that covers every form, edit check, skip logic rule, and query trigger, and released through formal authorization with complete documentation.

Our UAT process follows **GAMP 5** risk-based validation principles and satisfies **21 CFR Part 11** requirements for audit trails, access controls, and electronic signatures. Test scripts are created by a cross-functional team spanning data management, biostatistics, and clinical operations — because the people who will live with the system should be the ones who stress-test it.

---

### Continuous cleaning, not end-of-study panic

The industry standard for database lock is four to six weeks after last patient last visit. Trials that batch their data cleaning into that window routinely blow past it. Ours don't, because cleaning happens continuously from the day the first data point is entered.

Our data cleaning workflow operates in layers. **Automated edit checks** fire at data entry. **System-generated queries** route to sites immediately for discrepancy resolution. **Manual clinical review** by our data management team catches issues that algorithms can't — implausible medical histories, concomitant medication inconsistencies, adverse event narratives that don't match coded terms. **External data reconciliation** with central labs, ePRO/eCOA systems, IRT, safety databases, and imaging core labs follows defined schedules, not ad-hoc requests.

We track **query open rates per subject, median resolution time, discrepancy trends by site and form, and first-pass data entry accuracy** — and share these metrics with you in real time. If a site's query rate spikes, our monitoring team knows about it before the next scheduled visit.

---

### Medical coding with precision

Adverse events are coded to **MedDRA** (current version) and concomitant medications to **WHODrug Global**, using auto-coding engines supplemented by expert manual review for unmapped terms. Dictionary versions are locked at study startup; any mid-study version upgrade follows a defined recoding protocol with full impact assessment.

We conduct coding review meetings at pre-defined intervals, reconcile safety database coding with clinical database coding, and resolve discrepancies before they reach your medical monitor's desk.

---

### Database lock: structured, predictable, on schedule

Our database lock process follows a twelve-step protocol designed to eliminate the last-minute chaos that delays most studies:

From the parallel completion of final monitoring visits and query resolution, through external data reconciliation and medical coding finalization, to the formal data review meeting where data management, biostatistics, clinical operations, medical, and the sponsor jointly confirm lock readiness — every step has a defined owner, timeline, and completion criterion.

The soft lock enables comprehensive final review. The hard lock revokes write access, seals the audit trail, and extracts analysis-ready datasets. Post-lock, data flows directly into SDTM/ADaM production and TLF generation — because our statistical programming team has been working from your analysis plan since before the first patient enrolled.

---

# SERVICE PAGE: BIOSTATISTICS

---

## Biostatistics isn't a service you bolt on after enrollment. It's the strategic engine of your entire development program.

The most expensive mistake in clinical development is engaging your biostatistician too late. By the time a poorly powered sample size, an ill-defined estimand, or a missing sensitivity analysis surfaces at an FDA Type B meeting, you've already burned months and millions that can't be recovered.

Our biostatistics team doesn't wait for a locked database. They join your program at protocol concept — shaping study design, defining endpoints, modeling sample size, stress-testing assumptions, and building the analytic framework that determines whether your trial will generate the evidence regulators need to say yes.

---

### Statistical Analysis Plan development that prevents regulatory surprises

The SAP is the blueprint your entire submission rests on. We treat it accordingly.

Our SAP development process is co-led by a senior biostatistician working directly with your medical and clinical team. Development begins alongside the protocol — not after first patient first visit — and follows ICH E9 structure with full integration of the **ICH E9(R1) estimand framework**.

This means every primary and secondary endpoint has a clearly defined **estimand** — specifying the target population, the variable of interest, the strategies for handling intercurrent events (treatment discontinuation, rescue medication use, treatment switching), and the population-level summary measure. We pre-specify whether we're using treatment policy, hypothetical, composite, while-on-treatment, or principal stratum strategies — and we ensure the chosen strategy aligns with what the regulatory question actually is, not what's statistically convenient.

The SAP includes **TLF shells** reviewed and approved before programming begins, sensitivity analyses designed to test every critical assumption, subgroup analysis plans that avoid post-hoc data dredging, and a missing data strategy that connects directly to the estimand rather than defaulting to a generic multiple imputation approach.

---

### Adaptive designs and Bayesian approaches executed with regulatory rigor

Adaptive trial designs can reduce sample sizes, accelerate timelines, and increase the probability of identifying effective doses. They can also generate regulatory skepticism if the operating characteristics aren't bulletproof.

We design and execute **group sequential designs** with pre-planned interim analyses and formally computed stopping boundaries (O'Brien-Fleming, Lan-DeMets spending functions). We implement **sample size re-estimation** — blinded or unblinded — when early variance estimates deviate from planning assumptions. We support **seamless Phase II/III designs** that combine learning and confirmatory stages under a unified analytic framework.

For Phase I dose-finding, we apply **model-based designs** (CRM, BOIN, mTPI) calibrated through simulation to achieve target toxicity rates while minimizing patient exposure to subtherapeutic or toxic doses. Our **Bayesian adaptive approaches** leverage prior data to update posterior distributions as evidence accumulates — enabling more natural stopping rules and potentially reducing sample sizes by **15–37%** compared to traditional fixed designs.

Every adaptive design we propose comes with comprehensive **simulation-based operating characteristics** demonstrating Type I error control, power under multiple scenarios, and expected sample size distributions. We design for regulatory acceptance, not just statistical elegance.

---

### PK/PD analysis and dose-response modeling

Our pharmacometrics team provides **non-compartmental analysis (NCA)**, **population PK modeling** (NONMEM, Monolix), **exposure-response analysis**, and **PK/PD modeling** that connects drug concentrations to pharmacological effects. We support dose selection decisions, therapeutic window determination, Phase I-to-Phase II transitions, and the exposure-response narratives that increasingly drive FDA review.

For dose-response, we apply **MCP-Mod** (FDA-endorsed for Phase II dose-finding), **Emax modeling**, and **Bayesian model averaging** to account for model uncertainty. Our analyses are designed for regulatory submission from inception — formatted, annotated, and documented to satisfy reviewer expectations without rework.

---

### DMC support with operational firewalling

We provide complete **Data Monitoring Committee** support: charter development, unblinded interim analyses, open and closed session reports, and the operational firewalling that protects trial integrity. Our firewalling procedures ensure that unblinded information stays confined to the independent statistics team — with defined access controls, separate programming environments, and documented information barriers.

DMC deliverables are prepared by a dedicated unblinded biostatistician operating under strict SOPs, with QC performed within the firewalled environment before any materials reach the committee.

---

### Sample size and power: getting the fundamentals right

Underpowered trials waste resources. Overpowered trials waste patients. We calibrate **sample size calculations** using realistic effect size estimates, variance assumptions derived from comparable studies, and explicit accounting for dropout rates, multiplicity, stratification factors, and interim analyses.

Every sample size justification includes **sensitivity analyses** exploring how the required enrollment changes under different assumptions — because planning assumptions are always wrong, and the question is whether they're wrong enough to matter.

# SERVICE PAGE: STATISTICAL PROGRAMMING

---

## Submission-ready datasets and topline results, delivered on the timeline your investors are counting on

The distance between a locked database and a regulatory submission is measured in SDTM domains, ADaM datasets, TLFs, Define.xml files, Reviewer's Guides, and Pinnacle 21 validation reports. Every one of these deliverables must be technically flawless, CDISC-compliant, and internally consistent. And every day they're late costs your program momentum it cannot afford to lose.

Our statistical programming team doesn't start work at database lock. We begin SDTM mapping specifications and ADaM shells during study startup, build and validate datasets in parallel with data collection, and deliver topline results within weeks of lock — not months.

---

### CDISC implementation from Day 1, not retrofitted at submission

Retroactive SDTM and ADaM mapping — converting legacy datasets into CDISC-compliant formats after the fact — has been shown to consume **60% more resources** than prospective implementation. We eliminate this waste by embedding CDISC standards into study design.

**SDTM mapping specifications** are drafted during CRF design, ensuring that every collected data element has a defined pathway to its destination domain (DM, AE, LB, VS, EG, CM, EX, and custom domains as required). **Annotated CRFs** map each field to its SDTM variable. **Supplemental qualifiers** accommodate non-standard data without compromising structural integrity. All decisions are documented in the **Study Data Reviewer's Guide (SDRG)** — the narrative document that tells the FDA reviewer exactly what we did and why.

**ADaM datasets** — ADSL, BDS, ADAE, ADTTE, and others as specified by the SAP — are built with full traceability back to SDTM source data. The **Analysis Data Reviewer's Guide (ADRG)** documents every derivation, flag, and analysis decision, providing reviewers with the context they need to evaluate your submission without confusion or information requests.

---

### TLF production: accurate, validated, and on time

A typical clinical study generates **200 to 500+ tables, listings, and figures.** Each one must accurately reflect the SAP specifications, derive correctly from ADaM datasets, and present results in formats that support clear regulatory and clinical interpretation.

Our TLF production workflow operates from pre-approved shells developed jointly by biostatistics and the sponsor — eliminating the back-and-forth revisions that consume weeks in less disciplined organizations. Output programming and independent QC programming run in parallel, with results compared through automated validation tools (PROC COMPARE and equivalent methods). Discrepancies are investigated, resolved, and documented before any output reaches your team.

We produce outputs in RTF, PDF, and increasingly in interactive HTML formats for exploratory analyses. For topline results, we operate under compressed timelines with dedicated programming resources pre-assigned to your study — because the window between database lock and your board presentation doesn't accommodate scheduling delays.

---

### Pinnacle 21 validation: clean submissions, first time

Every SDTM dataset, ADaM dataset, and Define.xml file is validated against **Pinnacle 21** (the FDA's standard validation tool) before delivery. We target **zero critical errors** and document explanations for every remaining warning in Section 4.2 of the Reviewer's Guide.

We don't run Pinnacle 21 once at the end. We integrate validation into our development cycle — running checks iteratively as datasets are built, catching and resolving issues when they're simple to fix rather than when they threaten your submission timeline.

---

### Multi-language programming environments

**SAS** remains our primary programming language for regulatory submission datasets and TLFs — with the procedural depth (PROC LIFETEST, PROC PHREG, PROC MIXED, PROC FREQ) and regulatory acceptance that decades of industry use provide. Our programmers hold SAS clinical trials certifications and operate within validated computing environments.

We also maintain validated **R** capabilities for advanced visualization, Bayesian computing, interactive Shiny applications, and analyses leveraging the growing **{pharmaverse}** ecosystem (admiral for ADaM, rtables for TLF production, teal for data exploration). The FDA has accepted R-based submissions, and we support sponsors who prefer multi-language statistical computing environments.

**Python** augments our data engineering pipeline — automating data transforms, managing external data feeds, and supporting machine learning applications where appropriate.

---

### Define.xml and eSubmission readiness

Our **Define-XML v2.1** files are machine-readable metadata documents describing every dataset, variable, value-level attribute, controlled terminology reference, and computational method in your submission package. They're generated using validated tools and reviewed against the datasets they describe to ensure complete consistency.

The full eSubmission package — eCTD-formatted, with SAS transport (XPT) files within FDA size limits, Reviewer's Guides, annotated CRFs, and validation reports — is assembled, QC'd, and ready for your regulatory team to submit without rework.

# SERVICE PAGE: SITE MANAGEMENT

---

## Monitoring that finds what matters — not monitoring that checks every box

Traditional 100% source data verification consumes roughly a third of clinical trial operating budgets. It finds transcription errors. It rarely finds the systemic problems — protocol non-adherence, enrollment irregularities, data fabrication patterns — that actually threaten your trial's integrity.

We deploy a **risk-proportionate monitoring model** that combines centralized statistical monitoring, targeted on-site oversight, and remote review capabilities. The result: more meaningful oversight at lower cost, with monitoring resources directed where the data says they're needed most.

---

### Centralized monitoring that sees what site visits can't

A CRA reviewing patient binders at a single site cannot detect cross-site patterns. Our centralized monitoring function can.

Using **statistical data monitoring algorithms**, we analyze data across all sites simultaneously to identify anomalous patterns: unusual distributions of vital sign values, atypical adverse event reporting frequencies, digit preference in laboratory measurements, enrollment timing irregularities, and inlier/outlier patterns that suggest data quality problems a monitoring visit would never surface.

**Key Risk Indicators** are tracked against pre-defined thresholds in real-time dashboards. When a site's KRI profile shifts — enrollment slowing, query rates spiking, protocol deviation frequency increasing — our system flags it for targeted intervention before the problem compounds. This isn't surveillance. It's early detection that protects your data and your sites.

---

### Risk-based monitoring in practice

Our monitoring plans are built from the **FDA's three-step RBM framework**: identify critical data and processes, perform structured risk assessment, then design monitoring methods proportionate to those risks.

For **primary endpoint data and safety-critical assessments**, we apply targeted source data verification — confirming accuracy against source documents for the variables that determine your trial's outcome. For **lower-risk administrative data**, we use remote review and centralized checks that catch errors without the cost and logistics of on-site visits.

**On-site monitoring visits** are triggered by risk signals, not by calendar schedules. When centralized monitoring identifies a site needing additional oversight, we deploy a CRA with a specific mandate — investigate the flagged issue, verify the scope, implement corrective measures, and confirm resolution. This is more effective than routine visits where CRAs review everything and find nothing.

Remote monitoring leverages **eISF platforms** and secure document-sharing systems compliant with HIPAA and 21 CFR Part 11, enabling our monitors to review regulatory documents, informed consent forms, and source data without the delays and expense of travel.

---

### Site selection driven by data, not relationships

**30% of clinical trial sites enroll zero patients.** Poor site selection is the leading cause of enrollment delays, and enrollment delays cost sponsors up to **$8 million per day** in lost revenue opportunity.

We select sites based on **quantitative feasibility criteria**: historical enrollment performance in comparable studies, patient population access verified against claims and EHR data, PI therapeutic expertise and publication record, site infrastructure and staff capacity, competing study burden, and IRB/EC approval timelines. Geographic diversity and regulatory requirements are mapped against enrollment probability models to optimize the site network for speed and representativeness.

Our site activation process runs **parallel workstreams** — regulatory submissions, contract and budget negotiation, and site training proceed simultaneously rather than sequentially. We target **activation within 8–12 weeks** from site selection to site initiation visit, compared with the industry average of four to six months.

---

### Protocol deviation management that prevents recurrence

Protocol deviations are inevitable. Systemic deviations are not.

We classify deviations per FDA guidance — distinguishing important deviations that affect data reliability or subject safety from procedural deviations that require documentation but not escalation. Every important deviation triggers a **root cause analysis** and, where patterns emerge, a CAPA that addresses the underlying cause rather than the individual instance.

We trend deviations across sites and across studies — because a visit-window deviation pattern appearing at three different sites suggests a protocol feasibility problem, not a site training problem. This systemic view transforms deviation management from a compliance exercise into a protocol optimization tool.

---

### CRA team continuity

Monitor turnover is one of the most disruptive forces in clinical trial execution. Every CRA transition means lost site relationships, repeated learning curves, and monitoring gaps that compound over time.

We assign dedicated CRAs to your study and maintain them throughout the trial lifecycle. Our monitoring team structures are designed for continuity — with backup monitors briefed on every assigned site, handover protocols that preserve institutional knowledge, and compensation and career development practices that keep experienced monitors engaged.

# SERVICE PAGE: REGULATORY AFFAIRS

---

## Regulatory strategy that anticipates the question before the agency asks it

Regulatory submissions don't fail because the data was bad. They fail because the development strategy didn't anticipate what regulators would need to see — and by the time you discover the gap, it's too late to fill it without another study, another year, and another round of funding.

Our regulatory affairs team includes professionals with direct agency experience who have sat on the other side of the review. They know what triggers clinical holds, what FDA and EMA reviewers look for in pre-IND packages, what makes a successful End-of-Phase 2 meeting, and how to structure an NDA/BLA that moves through review without unnecessary information requests.

---

### From pre-IND through approval

We support the full regulatory lifecycle: **pre-IND strategy and meeting preparation, IND compilation and submission, IND maintenance** (annual reports, safety updates, protocol amendments), **End-of-Phase 2 meeting design**, **pivotal trial regulatory alignment**, **pre-NDA/pre-BLA meetings**, and **NDA/BLA/MAA compilation and submission** in eCTD format.

For programs pursuing accelerated pathways — Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, RMAT, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review — we map the regulatory strategy to pathway-specific requirements from Day 1 and maintain proactive agency communication throughout development.

We support global submissions including **FDA (US), EMA (EU), PMDA (Japan), Health Canada**, and other major regulatory authorities, with clinical trial applications (CTAs) prepared for multi-country submissions through CTIS and national portals.

---

### ICH E6(R3) readiness as competitive advantage

The most significant GCP revision in 30 years is now in effect. **ICH E6(R3)** — finalized January 2025 and adopted by EMA, FDA, MHRA, and Health Canada — fundamentally restructures how clinical trials are designed, conducted, and overseen. Quality by Design, risk-based quality management, Critical-to-Quality factors, proportionate oversight, and enhanced data governance are no longer aspirational — they're requirements.

Our systems, SOPs, and quality infrastructure are **fully aligned with E6(R3) today**. We've completed our gap analysis, updated our quality management system, integrated CtQ factor identification into protocol development workflows, and implemented the data governance frameworks the new guideline demands. For sponsors still operating under E6(R2) assumptions, we provide transition guidance to ensure your trials meet the new standard.

**[CTA: Schedule a Regulatory Strategy Discussion]**

---

# SERVICE PAGE: MEDICAL WRITING

---

## Documents that tell your compound's story clearly enough for a reviewer to say yes

Regulatory reviewers make decisions based on documents. The protocol defines what you intend to prove. The CSR demonstrates whether you proved it. The CTD modules present the totality of evidence. If any of these documents are unclear, inconsistent, or incomplete, your review timeline extends — and your approval probability drops.

Our medical writers are scientists who understand clinical data, not editors who format text. They work embedded within the biostatistics and clinical teams, drafting from data rather than about it, and producing documents that anticipate reviewer questions rather than generating them.

---

### Core deliverables

**Clinical study protocols** structured for operational clarity — with objectives, endpoints, estimands, and statistical methods aligned from the first draft, reducing the protocol amendments that delay **40% of clinical trials** before a single patient is enrolled.

**Clinical study reports** compliant with ICH E3, authored by writers who begin shell development before database lock so that first drafts are delivered within weeks of data availability — not months.

**Investigator's Brochures** maintained as living documents throughout your program, updated with each new safety signal, clinical result, or preclinical finding.

**CTD Modules 2–5** for regulatory submissions, **regulatory briefing documents** for agency meetings, **DSURs and PBRERs** for periodic safety reporting, and **clinical narratives** for individual patient safety cases.

# SERVICE PAGE: PHARMACOVIGILANCE

---

## Safety monitoring that protects your patients and your program

A single missed SUSAR reporting deadline can trigger regulatory action. A pattern of late safety reports signals systemic dysfunction to an inspector. Pharmacovigilance isn't a background function — it's a continuous obligation that requires disciplined processes, validated systems, and people who understand that timelines measured in calendar days leave no room for inefficiency.

We process individual case safety reports (ICSRs) through a validated workflow: triage, data entry, MedDRA coding, quality review, and regulatory submission — with **serious unexpected adverse reactions reported within 7 days (fatal/life-threatening) or 15 days (all other serious)**, as required. Our safety database operates on validated platforms with E2B R3 electronic transmission capability, CIOMS/MedWatch form generation, and full EudraVigilance and FAERS integration.

Signal detection combines quantitative disproportionality analysis (PRR, ROR) with qualitative clinical review, applied across spontaneous reports, clinical trial data, and scientific literature. Aggregate safety reports — DSURs, PSURs/PBRERs — are prepared on regulatory timelines with cross-functional input from clinical, biostatistics, and regulatory teams.

# SERVICE PAGE: PROJECT MANAGEMENT

---

## Project leadership that keeps your trial on track without adding bureaucracy

Clinical trial project management fails in two directions. Too little structure, and milestones drift, vendors fall out of sync, and problems surface too late to fix cheaply. Too much structure, and governance meetings consume the time that should be spent solving problems.

Our project management model is built on **integrated project teams** with defined RACI matrices, risk-based project planning with contingency built in, and governance structures scaled to your trial's actual complexity — not to a one-size-fits-all corporate template.

Your project lead manages cross-functional coordination across data management, biostatistics, programming, monitoring, regulatory, and safety teams — with financial oversight that tracks budget consumption against milestones and flags variance before it becomes a change order. Vendor oversight, CTMS-driven milestone tracking, and clear escalation pathways ensure that when decisions need to be made, the right people are in the room and the right information is on the table.

# "WHY US" / DIFFERENTIATORS PAGE

---

## Built differently, on purpose

### We're not the biggest CRO. We're the one that treats your trial like it's the only one that matters.

Large CROs optimize for scale. They standardize processes, rotate staff across portfolios, and prioritize accounts by revenue contribution. If your program isn't their largest contract, you know what that means for response times, team seniority, and how quickly your protocol amendment gets processed.

We built this organization for sponsors who need a CRO that operates at a high scientific level, moves at biotech speed, and treats every program as a strategic priority — because for most of our clients, it is.

---

### What "partnership" actually means here (not just a word on a website)

Every CRO says "partnership." Here's what it means operationally at ours:

**Your biostatistician joins at protocol concept.** Not at SAP development. Not at database lock. At the beginning — when statistical input into study design, endpoint selection, sample size assumptions, and estimand definition has the greatest impact on your program's probability of success.

**Your team is named in the contract.** The senior scientists and project leads assigned to your trial are identified before you sign, and our commitment to team continuity is a contractual obligation, not a best-effort aspiration.

**You see the same dashboard we do.** Quality metrics, enrollment tracking, data cleaning progress, query resolution rates, milestone status — you have access to the same information our internal teams use to manage your trial. No filtered reports. No curated updates designed to avoid difficult conversations.

**Problems surface early.** When something goes wrong — a site underperforming, an enrollment target at risk, a data quality issue emerging — you hear about it from us proactively, along with our assessment of impact and our proposed corrective action. We don't wait for the next governance meeting to deliver bad news.

---

### Biometrics as strategy, not a line item

Most CROs organize around clinical operations, with data management, biostatistics, and statistical programming treated as supporting functions. We invert that model.

**Our biometrics team is the strategic backbone of every program.** Data management, biostatistics, and statistical programming operate as an integrated unit — with shared accountability for data quality, analysis integrity, and submission readiness. Your data manager and biostatistician sit in the same team meeting, not in separate departments with a handoff form between them.

This integration produces tangible outcomes. CRF designs that map cleanly to SDTM domains. Edit checks that align with the analysis plan. SAPs that anticipate the data management challenges. SDTM and ADaM specifications drafted during study startup, not scrambled together after lock. The downstream result: **faster database locks, fewer post-lock issues, and submission packages that don't generate FDA information requests.**

### Broad therapeutic reach, deep scientific capability

We work across therapeutic areas — oncology, CNS, rare disease, immunology, cardiometabolic, infectious disease, and others — without diluting our scientific depth. Our teams include clinicians, biostatisticians, and data scientists with indication-level expertise, not just therapeutic-area-level familiarity.

This breadth is deliberate. Biotech innovation doesn't confine itself to a single disease area, and neither should your CRO partner's capability. What we won't do is take on a trial in a therapeutic area where we can't staff it with people who have relevant experience. We'd rather be honest about a gap than overpromise and underdeliver.

### Technology that accelerates without overcomplicating

We deploy AI and advanced analytics where they create measurable value — centralized monitoring anomaly detection, predictive enrollment modeling, automated CDISC validation, and medical coding assistance. We don't deploy them as marketing claims.

Our systems infrastructure supports decentralized and hybrid trial elements, EDC platform flexibility, external data integration from wearables and ePRO/eCOA systems, and the real-time data access that risk-based monitoring demands. We're built for the trials sponsors are running today and the trials they'll be running in three years.

### Flexible delivery, your way

**Full-service outsourcing** when you need a complete operational partner. **Functional service partnerships** when you want to embed our specialists within your organization's workflows. **Hybrid models** when your program needs both. We design the engagement around your needs, your infrastructure, and your budget — not around our preferred operating model.

## Homepage metrics strip (social proof bar)

Present as a horizontal metrics bar beneath the hero section:

- **[X]+** Clinical trials delivered
- **[X]+** Countries with operational capability
- **[X]%** Project team continuity rate
- **[X]%** On-time database lock delivery
- **[X]+** Regulatory submissions supported

*(Note: Populate with actual metrics. The specificity itself is the differentiator — no major CRO currently publishes operational quality metrics on their homepage.)*

## Suggested global CTAs (for use across pages)

- **Primary:** "Tell Us About Your Program" or "Speak With a Scientific Advisor"
- **Secondary:** "See How We Work" or "Explore Our Approach"
- **Bottom-funnel:** "Submit an RFP" or "Request a Proposal"
- **Content-gate:** "Download Our [Specific White Paper Title]"

Avoid: "Contact Us," "Learn More," "Get Started" — these are generic and carry no value proposition.

## Competitive positioning summary

The copy above is built on a differentiation framework that exploits seven documented gaps in current CRO market messaging:

1. **Biometrics as strategic hero** — no competitor positions data management, biostatistics, and programming as the central organizing principle of their CRO. All bury these services 3–4 clicks deep.

2. **Published quality metrics** — no major CRO currently publishes operational quality KPIs (team continuity rates, on-time delivery rates, query resolution metrics) on their website. Doing so immediately signals confidence and accountability.

3. **Radical transparency** — addressing the bait-and-switch problem, scope creep, and communication failures directly rather than pretending they don't exist in the industry.

4. **Named team commitments** — contractual team continuity obligations rather than "best-effort" staffing promises.

5. **Budget integrity** — explicitly addressing change-order anxiety with transparent scoping commitments.

6. **Plain language** — deliberately avoiding the corporate buzzwords (reimagine, transform, seamless, accelerate, best-in-class) that make every CRO sound identical.

7. **Biotech empathy** — acknowledging the specific pressures of emerging biotech sponsors (investor timelines, limited budgets, single-asset concentration risk) rather than repurposing big-pharma messaging with a "biotech solutions" label.

The tone throughout is confident without arrogance, specific without jargon overload, and consultative without being deferential. Every claim is grounded in operational commitments that can be verified, not aspirational language that cannot. This copy is designed to make a biotech VP of Clinical Development read two paragraphs and think: *these people actually understand what I'm dealing with.*
