## Hero

*Cardiovascular Clinical Research Since 1997*

### The cardiovascular CRO built by the cardiologists who lead your trials.

Our founders spent years watching the same tradeoff — academic centers that understood cardiac endpoints but couldn't run a 3,000-patient global trial, and large CROs that could run it but where the cardiologist from the pitch meeting vanished after kickoff. In 1997, they stopped watching and built TraceScribe Research.

## Leadership

### Led by the cardiologists who defined the field.

Our founders don't just advise — they're embedded in trial management from protocol to submission.

---

**[Founder Name], M.D.**
*Founder & Chief Scientific Officer*

Former Chief of Cardiology at a leading academic medical center. Principal Investigator on landmark heart failure trials. Co-founded a national heart failure society. Authored the first comprehensive heart failure practice guideline.

> "We built TraceScribe Research because we were tired of watching generalist CROs fail cardiovascular programs."

Personally oversees scientific strategy on every TraceScribe Research pivotal program from protocol concept through regulatory submission.

---

**[Founder Name], M.D.**
*Founder & Chief Medical Officer*

Chief of Cardiology at a leading academic medical center. Author of the nuclear cardiology chapter in a leading cardiology textbook. Past President of a national nuclear cardiology society. Led pivotal cardiac PET imaging trials.

> "When your FDA reviewer asks who read your PET images, you want that answer to end the conversation."

Directs the cardiovascular core laboratory and leads blinded independent cardiac imaging reads on every TraceScribe Research imaging program.

---

**[CEO Name], Ph.D., FCP**
*Chief Executive Officer*

Brings 25+ years of drug development and clinical operations leadership to TraceScribe Research's commercial execution.

---

**[Medical Director Name], M.D.**
*Medical Director*

Oversees medical monitoring, safety surveillance, and endpoint adjudication across all active TraceScribe Research trials.

## The Problem We Solve

### Every year, promising cardiac therapies fail — not because the science was wrong, but because the execution was.

**01 — Team rotation.** The scientists who win your business disappear after kickoff, replaced by junior associates learning your protocol on the fly.

**02 — Late data engagement.** Biostatisticians join at database lock instead of protocol concept — and spend months untangling what should have been designed correctly from the start.

**03 — Scope creep.** Conservative budgets turn into change orders. Timelines slip. Your PDUFA date moves.

*We built TraceScribe Research to solve these specific problems. Not with slogans, but with operational commitments we publish and measure against.*

---

## Three Commitments — Published. Measured.

**01 — "Your team stays your team."**
The scientists who design your statistical analysis plan deliver your topline results. We publish our team continuity rate because we believe you shouldn't have to take our word for it.

**02 — "Your data strategy starts at protocol design."**
Our biostatisticians join before the first CRF is built, not after the first patient enrolls. Estimand frameworks, CDISC standards, and adaptive designs are locked before enrollment opens.

**03 — "Your budget reflects reality."**
We scope conservatively and price honestly. Every change-order trigger is defined before you sign. No surprise invoices at database lock.

## Core Lab Spotlight

### Your cardiac imaging is read by the field's leading authority.

Our Core Laboratory performs blinded independent central reads led by a cardiologist who is a recognized authority in nuclear cardiology and led pivotal cardiac PET imaging programs. When your FDA reviewer asks who read your cardiac PET images, you want that answer to end the conversation.

- Echo
- Cardiac MRI
- Cardiac CT
- Nuclear/PET

## Data Management Timeline

### Your data strategy starts at Day 1, not Day 400.

1. **Day 1 — Protocol Concept** → Biostatistics & data management engaged
2. **CRF Design & CDISC Setup** → Standards locked before enrollment
3. **First Patient In** → Enrollment begins
4. **Continuous Cleaning** → Programmatic cleaning from first data
5. **Database Lock** → A formality, not a fire drill
6. **Topline Results** → Submission-ready outputs

Database lock isn't the finish line — it's the verdict on everything you built. CDISC-compliant datasets, estimand-aligned analysis plans, and continuous cleaning from first enrollment mean your DBL is a formality, not a fire drill.

---

## Global Reach

### 2,500+ specialized cardiovascular research sites across 16 countries.

Our global site network is specialized, not general-purpose. We monitor for geographic irregularities and maintain standardized conduct across every region.

- **North America** — 1,200+
- **Europe** — 800+
- **Asia-Pacific** — 350+
- **Latin America** — 150+

✓ Geographic irregularity monitoring across all active sites
✓ Standardized conduct protocols regardless of region
✓ Simplified management — one point of contact, not a bureaucracy

---

## Quality

### Audit-ready. Always.

Our quality management system is built on ICH E6(R2) risk-based principles with CAPA management, ALCOA+ data integrity standards, and continuous inspection readiness. Quality isn't a department at TraceScribe Research — it's an operating system.

ICH E6(R2) | ALCOA+ | Risk-Based Monitoring | CAPA Management
