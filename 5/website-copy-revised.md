# Tracescribe Research — Website Copy (Revised)

**Meta Description:** Tracescribe Research is a cardiologist-founded CRO focused exclusively on cardiovascular development, from protocol concept through regulatory submission.

## Hero

**Cardiovascular Clinical Research Since 1997**

### Cardiovascular evidence, designed at protocol, delivered at submission.

We created Tracescribe Research to close the gap between expert cardiology insight and large-trial execution. Our physician-scientists and biostatisticians stay embedded through the full lifecycle, designing endpoint strategy early and delivering submission-ready outputs through a specialized global CV site network.

Scientific leadership reviews every inquiry and responds within 48 hours.

## Trust Metrics

- Founded by Cardiologists: **1997**
- Specialized CV Sites: **2,500+**
- Countries: **16**
- Full Phase Range: **I–III**
- Team Continuity: **94%**
- FDA Complete Response Letters: **0**

## Leadership

### Led by cardiologists who defined the field.

Our founders do not operate as ceremonial advisors. They remain embedded in scientific strategy, medical oversight, and endpoint quality from first draft through final submission.

## The Execution Gap

### Promising cardiac therapies fail when execution architecture fails.

Most setbacks are operational, not scientific: rotating teams, late-stage data rescue, and budgets that fracture under pressure. We designed Tracescribe to remove those failure modes.

- **Team Rotation:** Experts who win the work are replaced after kickoff.
- **Late Data Engagement:** Biostatistics is engaged near lock instead of at protocol concept.
- **Scope Creep:** Reactive change orders damage timelines and confidence.

## Operating Commitments

### Published. Measured. Accountable.

- **Your team stays your team.** Scientific and statistical leads remain through topline interpretation.
- **Your data strategy starts at protocol design.** Biostatistics and data management engage before first CRF build.
- **Your budget reflects execution reality.** Change-order triggers are defined before signature.

## Services

### Full-spectrum cardiovascular clinical development.

From strategy to submission, one specialized team integrates clinical operations, data quality, analytics, and safety.

### Clinical Research Services

- Clinical Development Strategy
- Trial Planning & Design
- Clinical Operations
- Data Management
- Biostatistics
- Clinical Trial Analytics
- Pharmacovigilance & Safety

### Core Laboratory Services

- Cardiac Imaging Acquisition (Echo, MRI, CT, Nuclear/PET)
- Central Reading & Adjudication (BICR)
- Biomarker Core Services

## Core Lab Spotlight

### When image credibility matters, authority matters.

Tracescribe's blinded independent central reads are led by specialists with direct experience in pivotal cardiac imaging programs. The standard is simple: the reader profile must withstand regulator-level scrutiny.

## Data Strategy Timeline

### Your data strategy starts at Day 1, not Day 400.

Database lock is not a rescue event. It is the outcome of decisions made before enrollment begins.

1. **Day 1 — Protocol Concept**  
Biostatistics and data management engage at concept stage.
2. **Design — CRF + CDISC Setup**  
Standards and structures are locked before first patient in.
3. **FPI — Enrollment Begins**  
Execution starts on pre-validated operational and data rails.
4. **Live — Continuous Cleaning**  
Programmatic checks run from first data, not near lock.
5. **DBL — Database Lock**  
A quality confirmation milestone, not an emergency sprint.
6. **Final — Topline + Submission Outputs**  
Submission-ready datasets and analyses delivered with traceability.

## Global Reach

### 2,500+ specialized cardiovascular sites across 16 countries.

Regional distribution:
- North America: **1,200+**
- Europe: **800+**
- Asia-Pacific: **350+**
- Latin America: **150+**

Operational standards:
- Geographic irregularity monitoring
- Standardized conduct protocols across regions
- Single accountable point of contact

## Quality

### Audit-ready. Always.

Our QMS aligns with ICH E6(R2) risk-based principles, CAPA governance, ALCOA+ data integrity standards, and continuous inspection readiness.

**Frameworks:** ICH E6(R2), ALCOA+, Risk-Based Monitoring, CAPA Management
